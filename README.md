# RedVSBlue-
Project 2 Columbia Cybersecurity bootcamp

In the second project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Red Team attack. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, I interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I performed. I am presenting my project through a thourough powerpoint presentation showing in order the Red Team vs Blue team perspectives.
